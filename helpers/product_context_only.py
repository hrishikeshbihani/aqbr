message_VS = """Video KYC Journey Overview:
1. Video KYC (Know Your Customer) is conducted for user verification.
Each client is identified by a unique OUID (Organization Unique Identifier).
Operators/agents conduct the KYC process for end customers.
Activities of operators, end customers, and reviewers are logged for analysis.

2.Key Steps in the Video KYC Journey:
Profile Creation: When a new customer begins the KYC journey, a ProfileID is generated internally. Each client/OUID has a unique ExtReferenceID linked to their ProfileID.
Capture Window: Customers log in and perform activities. A CaptureSessionID is created for each session, associated with the ProfileID.
Queue Assignment: Assisted Video sessions are assigned to specific queues based on language and skill preferences. QueueID or QueueName is recorded in the data.
Assisted Video (AV): Customers move to assisted video sessions with a designated agent. Each session has a unique AVSessionID. Agents create tasks for profile details, associated with ProfileID and AVSessionID.
Profile Verification: Agents verify profiles or mark them as UTV (Unable To Verify) based on profile status. Reviewed profiles proceed to the reviewer.
Review Process: Reviewers verify documents and complete tasks. They can also reject profiles with reasons provided.

3.Data Logging and Analysis:
All activities, including operator, customer, and reviewer actions, are logged in ClickHouse tables.
Key data includes ProfileID, ExtReferenceID, CaptureSessionID, AVSessionID, AgentID, TaskID, QueueID/QueueName, ProfileStatus, and Reason.
TTL (Time To Live) fields are set for data retention in ClickHouse tables.
In summary, the Video KYC process involves multiple steps, including queue assignment during assisted video sessions. Data from these activities is logged for analysis, facilitating insights into operator performance, customer behavior, and verification outcomes.
