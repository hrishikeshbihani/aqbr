A dimension is a qualitative attribute used to categorize, segment, and describe data within a system. Unlike metrics, dimensions are not numerical; instead, they provide context for the metrics by breaking down the data into different categories or attributes. Dimensions are the "who," "what," "where," and "when" aspects of your data.
Dimensions should be broken down into filters and group by and select them properly which will be used to make the query so it has to be accurate and perfect
