A metric is a quantitative measure used to track and assess the status of a specific process, activity, or performance within a system. Metrics are numerical values that provide insights into how something is performing. They are typically used to gauge performance, effectiveness, or progress over time.

The Table metadata contains <metrics> and <dimension> tag use that information for selecion

The Product Context: {product_description}
Table metadata: {table_metadata}
